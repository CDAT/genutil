This directory contains the source code for mars obtained from SNL.  It has been modified
only slightly with initialization and comments to make it safer to use.  The user should
be aware that consecutive execution with the same inputs could produce different output.
This happens when using a cross validation of 2 for example. The reason is that under the
hood the weights are changed in cvmars (stands for cross validation mars).  Take a look
at the mars test named test_mars.py in the tests directory.
