Pymars is a faithful conversion of the mars application. It is far less obscure than the original fortran
but it too needs work. The original conversion computed the response surface that mars computed. The
answers were the same! For some reason the version here does NOT get the same answer. I don't know why.
I believe that I have the right source code and it is setup in the same way as before. I suspect that
there is some initialization that is not executed but I'm not sure. It is worthwhile to pursue this
at some point and make sure that mars and pymars agree.
